# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and number of rooms using a **RandomForestRegressor** from the **scikit-learn** library.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that accurately estimates housing prices. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical housing data, and it uses the **Random Forest Regressor** algorithm for prediction.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
